Common pod issues in Kubernetes and their resolutions

1. Kubernetes is unable to pull the container image:-

 Check image name: Ensure the image name and tag are correct.
 Check image registry: Ensure the image is available in the specified container registry.
 Credentials: If the image is in a private registry, make sure the proper image pull secret is configured and associated with the pod.
 Command: Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to see the exact error message related to image pulling.
================================================================================================
2. Pods keep crashing and restarting:-

 Check logs: Use kubectl logs <pod-name> to check the application logs for errors.
 Describe the pod: Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to get more detailed information about the pod's state and recent events.
 Resource limits: Ensure the pod has enough CPU and memory. Adjust resources.requests and resources.limits in the pod spec if necessary.
 Health checks: Ensure your readiness and liveness probes are correctly configured to reflect the application's state.
================================================================================================
3. Pods are being killed due to running out of memory:-

 Resource limits: Set appropriate resources.requests and resources.limits for memory in the pod spec.
 Memory leaks: Check your application for memory leaks or inefficiencies.
 Monitoring: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor memory usage and adjust the resources accordingly.
================================================================================================
4. Pods remain in the "Pending" state and are not scheduled:-

 Resource availability: Ensure there are enough resources (CPU, memory) available in the cluster to schedule the pod. Check with kubectl describe node.
 Node selectors and affinities: Verify that any node selectors, affinities, or taints and tolerations are correctly configured and match available nodes.
 Cluster capacity: If the cluster is running out of resources, consider scaling up the cluster by adding more nodes.
================================================================================================
5. Pods are not scheduled because nodes are in the "NotReady" state:-

 Node status: Check the status of nodes with kubectl get nodes.
 Kubelet status: Ensure the kubelet service is running on the node.
 Network issues: Check for network connectivity issues between the node and the control plane.
 Node health: Investigate node-specific issues such as disk pressure, memory pressure, or PID pressure.
