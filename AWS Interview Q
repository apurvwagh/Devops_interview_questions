Scenario based question
---------------------
- Supoose i have created one ec2 instance and i want access s3 bucket and that s3 bucket is not public.
- Suppose i have ASG with 2 instance, now i want reboot the one of the instance without recreating it.
- Following is CIDR range 10.105.0.0/27, By using this cidr tell me the IP count. How many IP you will get.


Route53
----------
- Blue Green Deployment? How can achive in AWS?

===========================================================================================================
- What are the types of Route 53 policies?
Simple routing policy – Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website. 
You can use simple routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Geolocation routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users. You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Geoproximity routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally,
shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another location. You can use geoproximity routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency. 
You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

IP-based routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users, and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.

Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. 
You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. You can use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Types Of Routing Policy
Simple Routing: 
	- It allows to configure DNS with no special Route 53 Routing. It is mainly used when you have a single resource that performs a given function for 	your domain.
Failover Routing: 
	- It routes traffic to another or alternate resource when the previous resource is unhealthy. Route request from primary region to secondary region
Geolocation routing policy: 
	- Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of users.
Geo-proximity routing policy: 
	- Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources.
Latency-based Routing: 
	- Use when you have resources across multiple AWS regions and want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.
Weighted routing policy: 
	- Use to route traffic to multiple resources as per the provided weightage.
